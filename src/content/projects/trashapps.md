    Trashapps is a curated collection of small, seemingly trivial but surprisingly useful interactive web applications. The project explores how minimal design and simple interactions can still provide meaningful utility or entertainment.

    Designed primarily for mobile environments, Trashapps integrates short-form interaction patterns and donation-based engagement mechanisms. The collection serves as an experimental space for rapid prototyping, UI experimentation, and lightweight service design.
