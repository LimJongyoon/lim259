    Smart Cradle is an AI-driven healthcare system designed to monitor newborn health and prevent sudden infant death. While wearable healthcare devices are widely available for adults, comparable solutions for newborns remain limited despite their critical need for continuous monitoring.

    The Smart Cradle integrates multiple sensing modalities, including facial expression analysis, weight measurement, air quality monitoring, oxygen saturation (SpO2), oxygen levels, and pulse tracking. By combining these signals with AI-based analysis, the system can infer feeding needs, bowel movement timing, and overall health status.

    The project covers concept design, industrial design, circuit design, hardware–software development, and sales, representing a full-stack approach from prototype to real-world deployment.
