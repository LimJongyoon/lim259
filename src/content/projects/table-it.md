    Table-It is an interactive AR table system that uses vision-based motion and color recognition to transform a physical table into a large-scale interactive interface. The project received the Korean Government Minister’s Award at EFESTA 2017.

    Hand motion recognition enables users to control a cursor and perform click actions by opening and closing their hands, effectively replicating standard computer interactions. Color recognition allows the system to support applications such as table tennis and billiards, which are difficult to implement on conventional tablets.

    The project demonstrates how computer vision and projection-based AR can extend everyday surfaces into interactive computing platforms.
