    Starbound Odyssey is a VR game that simulates the experience of a spacewalk using toon shading and stylized texturing. The project contrasts cartoon-like visual aesthetics with realistic spatial physics to create a distinctive immersive experience.

    Players explore cosmic environments, interact with celestial objects, and navigate space in a richly stylized universe. The project emphasizes visual storytelling, shading techniques, and experiential design in VR.
