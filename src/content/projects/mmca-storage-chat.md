    MMCA Storage Chat Mobile is a personalized conversational AI docent developed for the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art. The system provides real-time, interactive explanations of artworks using generative AI, based on either visitor location or photos taken by the user.

    Unlike traditional museum guide systems that rely on static audio or text-based information, this AI docent supports contextual dialogue, inference, and follow-up questions. By integrating BLE-based indoor positioning and camera-based image recognition, the system delivers location-aware and visually grounded explanations.

    The project covers concept design, UX/UI design, and mobile app development, demonstrating how conversational AI can enhance cultural heritage experiences.
