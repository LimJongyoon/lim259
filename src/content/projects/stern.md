    Stern is an immersive AR exhibition that invites visitors to explore a virtual cityscape layered onto physical space. Using head-mounted displays and interactive electronic elements, the exhibition blends urban scenery with reflective, question-driven interactions.

    As visitors progress through the exhibition, their responses contribute to a personal data profile. In the final stage, participants receive a personalized analysis, offering insight into their personality and preferences. Stern explores how spatial storytelling and AR can support reflective and participatory experiences.
