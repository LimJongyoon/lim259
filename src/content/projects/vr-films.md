    The Glasses is an interactive VR film that enables audience participation through physical gestures performed in the real world. By wearing and removing virtual sunglasses, users transition between past and present scenes within the narrative.

    This interaction model shifts the audience from passive viewers to active participants, enhancing emotional immersion and narrative engagement. The project explores how embodied interaction can deepen storytelling in VR cinema.
