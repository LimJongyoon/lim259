    EverPen 2.0 is a next-generation spatial input device designed to redefine interaction in virtual and mixed reality environments. Unlike conventional VR controllers that rely on external tracking systems or constrained interaction metaphors, EverPen 2.0 operates independently within a 3D coordinate system, enabling precise position tracking without external stations.

    The system integrates advanced hand tracking with embedded touch and physical sensors, allowing natural pen-like gestures for writing, drawing, and spatial manipulation. This design positions EverPen 2.0 as a human interface device (HID) for spatial computing, analogous to the role of the mouse in desktop computing or the Apple Pencil in tablet ecosystems.

    The project encompasses concept design, circuit design, embedded system development, and hardware–software integration, as well as real-world deployment through exhibitions and sales. EverPen 2.0 was exhibited at CES 2024 and CES 2025 and received a Korean Government Minister’s Award, demonstrating both technical maturity and commercial potential.
