This study introduces “Guide Dog AR,” an AR device inspired by the handle of a guide dog’s harness. The device and its associated content aim to provide visually impaired individuals with the experience of walking with a guide dog, serving as both a practical tool and a foundation for entertainment. The device offers an augmented walking experience through tactile and auditory sensations. The device was assessed with the factors "effectiveness" and "immersiveness." The evaluation for effectiveness involved creating a simulated virtual path. The level of immersion was evaluated based on how deeply users were engrossed in the augmented content provided by the device. The success rate was determined by how well users navigated this virtual path using the device’s feedback. In assessing immersion, in-depth interviews were conducted with visually impaired participants who experienced the virtual path using the Guide Dog AR device. These interviews focused on the participants' perceptions of presence, their engagement with the tactile and auditory feedback, and how closely the experience resembled real-world navigation with a guide dog. The results indicated that participants found the device to be both effective in navigating the virtual path and immersive in creating a lifelike experience, enhancing their confidence and enjoyment during the task. The study concludes that Guide Dog AR has the potential to serve as both an assistive technology and an engaging entertainment platform for visually impaired individuals.
